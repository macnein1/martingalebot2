# End-to-End Coordination + Traceability + Testing Implementation Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the implementation of the End-to-End Coordination, Traceability, and Testing system for Martingale Lab.

## 🎯 Objective Achieved

Implemented a comprehensive end-to-end system that ensures proper flow from martingale_lab (backend) → storage (SQLite) → UI (Streamlit) with complete structured logging, metrics, state tracking, and evidence recording at every step.

## 📋 Implementation Overview

### 1. Structured JSON Logging Infrastructure ✅

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `martingale_lab/utils/structured_logging.py` (NEW)
- `ui/utils/logging_buffer.py` (ENHANCED)

**Key Features:**
- `JSONFormatter` for automatic JSON formatting of all log messages
- Standardized event names as constants (`EventNames` class)
- Common fields: `ts`, `lvl`, `event`, `run_id`, `exp_id`, `span_id`, `batch_idx`, `eval_count`, `adapter`, `overlap`, `orders`, `score`, `duration_ms`
- `StructuredLogger` wrapper with context-aware logging
- Integration with existing RingBuffer system
- Support for live trace streaming with JSON logs

**Event Categories:**
- `APP.*`: Application lifecycle (START, STOP)
- `BUILD.*`: Configuration building
- `ORCH.*`: Orchestrator events (START, BATCH, SAVE_OK, PRUNE, EARLY_STOP, DONE, ERROR)
- `EVAL.*`: Evaluation events (CALL, RETURN, ERROR)
- `DB.*`: Database events (INIT, UPSERT_EXP, UPSERT_RES, VERIFY, ERROR)
- `UI.*`: User interface events (CLICK_START, CLICK_STOP, RESULTS_LOAD, EXPORT)

### 2. Identity Management System ✅

**Implementation:**
- `run_id`: Format `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<6hex>` generated for each optimization run
- `exp_id`: Database autoincrement ID for experiments
- `span_id`: Format `batch-<idx>` for batch tracking
- All function calls now include mandatory `run_id`/`exp_id` parameters
- Comprehensive logging and DB recording with identities

### 3. Enhanced Evaluation Contract ✅

**Files Modified:**

**Strict Contract Compliance:**
```json
{
  "score": float,
  "max_need": float,
  "var_need": float,
  "tail": float,
